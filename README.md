# EduChain

Content creators can use the EduChain platform to create their own Android applications for their content.
Content creators can sign up for the platform and upload their work. After uploading their video or audio content, an android application will be generated for them. The content can be either free or paid.

### Warning
During the open-sourcing project, some parts of the code and tests were removed.
